## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Logical properties

### What I learned

With this challenge I refresh my knowledge with:

- CSS Custom Properties how to use and naming them;
- Flexbox;
- how to use <picture> element;
- how to use @import to import the font from Google Fonts;
- work with modern CSS Logical Properties and Relative Units;
- Fluid Typography.

```css
  .card {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      max-width: 20rem;
      margin-inline: auto;
      background: var(--clr-cardBG);
      padding: 1em;
      border-radius: 20px;
      text-align: center;
  }
```

### Continued development

For the future projects I want to continue focusing on CSS Grid, Container Queries, JavaScript and HTML/CSS in general to become more confident with my knowledge
